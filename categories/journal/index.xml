      <description>I attended a wedding reception of a member of my band at Osaka.
Our band had a performance there, which was exciting and I belive we did well. Actually I had gotten my thumb burned last week and I still had a blister at that time, but fortunately it didn&amp;rsquo;t affect my play because the stick didn&amp;rsquo;t hit the blister.
Having said that, an injury at a thumb makes me inconvenient in doing anything, and I can&amp;rsquo;t go bouldering until it heals.</description>

      <title>My First Journal</title>

      <description>To improve my English skill, I decided to try &amp;ldquo;journaling&amp;rdquo;. Journaling is introduced as a method to improve English speaking skill by writing journals in English and memorizing phrases in them. Journaling helps me increase my vocabularies and prepare for using phrases in English conversations.
So I opened this blog and I&amp;rsquo;d like to try writing journals as often as possible. The primal purpose of this blog is to improve my English skill rather than express my thoughts.</description>
